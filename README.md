# Introduction to Python for Machine Learning
Electric Utilities report a huge amount of information to government and public agencies. They include very granular data on fuel burned, electricity generated, power plant usage patterns, plant capacity factors and emissions from greenhouse gases. However, this data is not well documented and sometimes they are provided in a format that makes it difficult to understand.
This course  explores how  machine learning techniques can be an invaluable tool for ## solving one of the grand challenges posed to humanity - climate change.
